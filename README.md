# ArgMicro_Russian
Russian version of ArgMicro corpus.

Argumentative Microtext Corpus ([ArgMicro](http://angcl.ling.uni-potsdam.de/resources/argmicro.html)) is the corpus with argumentation annotation created by Applied CL Discourse Research Lab.

This corpus consists of two parts. Part 1 (2015) [1] contains 112 short texts in English and in German (from 3 to 10 sentences) on various topics (raising retirement age, health insurance, school uniform, etc.). Part 2 (2018) [2] contains 171 texts in English only (from 2 to 10 sentences) on various topics as well (poaching, cell phones and social media addiction, recycling, etc.).

We translated ArgMicro corpus into Russian by a professional translator (`translated_partN_human.zip`) and using three machine translation systems: Google Translate, Yandex.Translate and Promt (`translated_partN_machine.zip`). We studied these translated versions in the paper [3].
